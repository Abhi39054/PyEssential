# How to Build Distribution Files

Before you can upload your package to PyPI or TestPyPI, you need to create distribution files. These are the archives that `pip` uses to install your package on other machines. The two main types are:

*   **Source Distribution (`sdist`)**: A `.tar.gz` file containing your source code and metadata.
*   **Built Distribution (`wheel`)**: A `.whl` file that is pre-built and can be installed more quickly.

This guide will walk you through creating both.

## 1. Install Required Tools

You'll need the `build` package to create the distribution files and `twine` to upload them. It's best to install them together.

```bash
pip install build twine
```

## 2. Run the Build Command

From the root directory of your project (the same directory that contains `pyproject.toml`), run the following command:

```bash
python -m build
```

This command reads your project's metadata from `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` and generates the distribution files.

## 3. Verify the Output

After the command completes successfully, you will find a new `dist/` directory in your project root. Inside, you should see your source distribution and wheel files.

```
dist/
├── pyessential-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
└── pyessential-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

With these files created, you are now ready to upload your package.
