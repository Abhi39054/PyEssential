# How to Run Test Cases

This guide explains how to set up your environment and run the test suite for `PyEssential`. Running tests is a critical step to ensure that your changes are correct and do not break existing functionality.

## 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    From the root of the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Environment**
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```powershell
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    -   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

## 2. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment active, install the project in "editable" mode along with the testing framework (`pytest`). Editable mode (`-e`) links the installed package to your source code, so any changes you make are immediately reflected.

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install pytest
```

## 3. Run the Tests

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the entire test suite with a single command from the project's root directory:

```bash
pytest
```
