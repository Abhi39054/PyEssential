# How to Publish Your Package to PyPI

The process for creating an account on the official PyPI is very similar to TestPyPI, but with a mandatory security step: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

Here is the step-by-step guide to creating your account on the official PyPI and generating your API token for publishing.

## 1. Create Your PyPI Account 🔐

1.  **Go to the Registration Page**
    -   Open your web browser and navigate to the official PyPI registration page: [https://pypi.org/account/register/](https://pypi.org/account/register/)

2.  **Fill in the Form**
    -   You will be asked to provide:
        -   **Username**: Choose a unique username.
        -   **Email address**: Enter a valid email.
        -   **Password**: Create a strong password.
    -   You may also need to complete a CAPTCHA.

3.  **Submit and Verify**
    -   Click "Create Account".
    -   Check your email inbox for a verification link from PyPI and click it to activate your account.

## 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Mandatory) 📱

PyPI requires two-factor authentication to secure accounts, especially for package maintainers.

1.  Log in to your newly created PyPI account.
2.  Navigate to your **Account Settings** (accessible from the top-right user menu).
3.  Find the **Two-Factor Authentication** section.
4.  **Configure 2FA**: You will be prompted to set up an authenticator application (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator) or a security key (like a YubiKey).
    -   **Using an Authenticator App**: PyPI will provide a QR code. Scan it with your chosen app.
    -   **Verify**: Enter the temporary code generated by your app back into the PyPI website to complete the setup.
5.  **Save Recovery Codes**: PyPI will generate a list of recovery codes.

> **Critical!**
> Download and store these codes in a very safe place (like a password manager). These are the only way to access your account if you lose your 2FA device.

## 3. Generate an API Token 🔑

Using an API token is the most secure way to upload packages, as it avoids using your main password.

1.  While logged in, go back to your **Account Settings**.
2.  Navigate to the **API tokens** section.
3.  Click **Add API token**.
4.  Configure the token:
    -   **Token name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `PyEssential-Publish-Token`).
    -   **Scope**: For maximum security, select **Project** and choose your package name. If you prefer a general-purpose token, you can choose **Entire account**, but this is less secure.
5.  Click **Add Token**.

> **Important!**
> Copy the generated token immediately. This is the **only time** PyPI will show you the full token value. Save it in a secure location.

## 4. Upload to PyPI

Once your distribution files are built, you can upload your package using Twine.

> **Note:** Before uploading a new version, remember to increment the version number in your project's configuration (`pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg`).

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

When prompted, enter `__token__` for the username and paste your new PyPI API token for the password.

```text
Enter your username: __token__
Enter your password: <paste your PyPI token here>
```

After a successful upload, your package will be live on the official Python Package Index!
