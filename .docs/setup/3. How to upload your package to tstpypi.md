> **Important Note about TestPyPI**
> ⚠️ The database for TestPyPI is sometimes periodically pruned (cleared). This means your user account or test packages may be deleted. It is solely intended for testing the packaging and upload process, not for long-term storage.

## Create an API Token

Once your account is registered, the recommended practice for uploading packages is to use an API Token instead of your username and password.

1.  Log in to your new TestPyPI account.
2.  Go to your **Account Settings** (usually accessible from the dropdown menu in the top right corner).
3.  Navigate to the **API tokens** section.
4.  Click **Add API token**.
5.  Give the token a meaningful name (e.g., "Twine Uploader").
6.  For the scope, select **Entire account (all projects)**.
7.  Click **Add Token**.

> **Important!**
> Copy the token value immediately and save it in a secure location. You will not be able to see it again.

## Upload to TestPyPI

To upload your package, run the following command in your terminal. This assumes you have already built your distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

When prompted for a username, enter `__token__`.

When prompted for a password, paste the API token you copied earlier.

```text
Enter your username: __token__
Enter your password: <paste your token here>
```

After a successful upload, your package will be available on TestPyPI.
